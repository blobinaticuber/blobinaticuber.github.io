    <h1>Fitness</h1>

    <h3>Bike Racing</h3>
    <p>From 2013-2016 I competed in a few bike races across Oregon. A couple of times I got 1st place, but this was usually just because I was the only person competing within my age bracket. See my results <a href="https://obra.org/people/94524/2013">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Running</h3>
    <a>My first runs were in high school during PE class. At the end of the year all of the freshman had to run a 5k, which I quite enjoyed. In my first year at university, I decided I should join some clubs, and saw that there was a trail running club. I met some great people, learned a lot, and competed in a few races! I stopped running in 2023, but have recently picked it back up. Below are some notable accomplishments:</a>
    <ul>
        <li>October 3, 2021: <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Rowan&lname=Fortier&age=18">Bend Bigfoot 10k</a>. My first race, it was an easy trail that was mostly downhill.</li>
        <li>March 6, 2022: <a href="https://eclecticedgeracing.overallraceresults.com/individual-results/551/373615">Mastondon 10-ish Mile Trail Run</a>.</li>
        <li>May 21, 2022: Ran a half-marathon in 2h 21m with some friends from the running club (Huge thanks to Danny, Chris, and all).</li>
        <li>June 22, 2025: Fastest 1 mile time of 7m 21s.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weightlifting</h3>
    <p>Inspired by my friend Lucas, I began hitting the gym in January 2025.</p>
