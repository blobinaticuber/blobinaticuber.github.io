    <h3><a href="https://hypercubing.xyz">Hypercubing Website</a></h3>
    <p>A wiki and leaderboard for the hypercubing community. I worked on the content and organization for many of the pages, the customization options on the leaderboard page, as well as verification of leaderboard submissions.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/blobinaticuber/3x3x3-simulator">3x3x3 Simulator</a></h3>
    <p>My first ever good, functioning Rubik's Cube simulator program. It uses linear algebra for graphics, as well as keeping track of the puzzle state. There are keybinds for twists and rotations, as well as mouse controls to view the puzzle from different angles.</p>


    <h3><a href="/funnyclocks.html">Funny Clocks</a></h3>
    <p>A quick little page I built with javascript to show some funny timekeeping methods.</p>

    <h3><a href="/highd.html">Some graphics test thing using WebGL</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/blobinaticuber/stella-magnus-1.19.4">Stella Magnus</a></h3>
    <p>A Minecraft mod for 1.19.4 that aimed to extend the base game's progression system by introducing new tiers of items found across different dimensions based on the planets in our solar system. Programming a Minecraft mod turned out to be very tedious and difficult to learn, but I did get a moon dimension with custom terrain and ore generation working, as well as some tools and crafting recipies.</p>
