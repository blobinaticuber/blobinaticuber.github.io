# Rowan Fortier

This is the personal website of Rowan Fortier. It's like seeing a soup of my random thoughts ðŸ¦žâœ¨

## Projects
- [Hypercubing Website](https://hypercubing.xyz): A wiki and leaderboard for the Hypercubing community.
- [3x3x3 Simulator](https://github.com/blobinaticuber/3x3x3-simulator): My first real Rubik's Cube simulator, using linear algebra.
- [Funny Clocks](/page.html): A thing I made to display some funny timekeeping methods.


### YouTube
I've been making videos on various channels since I was 9 years old.

- [Rowan Fortier](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVi5_vhosSdK8PEGE_4A2fg) (My main channel. Currently all 500+ non-cubing related videos are hidden)
- [Rowan Fortier +](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgJt-_7cF3SC53p3_q20Hmg) (2nd channel, filled with random stuff)
- [Zaney Cuber](https://www.youtube.com/@zaneycuber6033) (My old cubing channel)
- [ASMR Everything](https://www.youtube.com/@asmreverything6045) (Silly thing I made when I was young)
- [What If](https://www.youtube.com/@whatif9275) (Even sillier channel, inspired by alternate history channels)
- [Pineapple Salad Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@pineapplesaladgaming3845) (A channel I made with a friend with the intent to make gaming videos in)
- If you find the other 2 channels that are mine that no one knows about, message me for a reward...

The universe has captivated my interest since I was a wee lad.
