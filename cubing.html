    <h2>How I got started</h2>
    <p>Some time in March 2016 I saw my mom playing with a Rubik's Cube, and we decided to race to see who could build a side of a single colour the fastest. She always won, so one day I looked up a full tutorial on how to solve the cube, and pretended like I had figured it out myself to show off to my mom. My first ever timed solve was about 10 minutes.</p>

    <p>I've been to 11 official WCA competitions, although I'm not very good. Below is a playlist of my vlogs from those.</p>

    <h2 id="rubiks-cube">Hypercubing</h2>
    <p>In 2021, I learned of the 4-Dimensional Rubik's Cube. It took me a week to solve it by following a written guide online. Since then I have (briefly) held the 3x3x3x3 speedsolving world record, helped create the hypercubing.xyz wiki, solved the 5D and 6D cubes, and helped foster the community on the Discord server.</p>
